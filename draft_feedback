Section 1:
a. Add more introduction about MR (background, rationale), two-sample MR (background and why it's popular). Currently, the intro is more geared towards RCTs and why people would use an IV, not necessarily why people may use two-sample MR.
   - TBD
b. Better integrate bounds into two-sample MR, specifically discussing why bounds may be appealing in the two-sample MR setting (e.g. less assumptions?)
   - TBD

Section 1.1: 
I think a deeper review of bounds literature in both IV and MR settings is required, including pointing out each work's contribution to the bounds literature. We would also have to include references for falsification inequality literature since they are related.
  - TBD

Section 2.2:
a. (A1) and (A4) may be the same and if so, unite them? See Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen and Linbo Wang's recent paper in JRSS:B https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09925v2
   - merged (A1 => A4)
b. We should state SUTVA/consistency as another assumption.
   - Y = XY^1 + (1-X)Y^0 included as SUTVA
   - Y^x = ZY^{x,1} + (1-Z)Y^{x,1} included as "consistency of potential outcomes" ??????

   - Combined to one.

c. There should be brief discussions about the plausibility of these assumptions in two-sample MR, with references on whether they have been used in past MR studies. I would suggest looking at Lawlor et al. here as a starting point: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.3034
   - included a few short paragraphs discussing this issue

Section 2.3:
a. Varrow is rarely used; you can simply use bold or skip the bolding all-together.
   - TBD
b. In general, this section feels like it is written towards an audience who is very familiar with the bounding literature or for those who can read mathematical proofs. Since the paper is geared more towards MR folks who are primarily epidemiologists with minimal training in this area, I think explaining this that audience in mind might be most useful. For example, for every math equation, I would provide some heuristic explanation as to how this step comes about and/or why this step is needed. If you can explain this section to a quantitative-oriented person who is not necessarily a statistician, you've succeeded in wording this section properly. As long as it's more readable to a quantitative-oriented person than right now, I think that's a success.
   - TBD
c. Also, we can add a brief note here (or in one of the latter sections) about the lower bound < upper bound and explore this in detail in the supp with the plots you showed me.
   - TBD

Section 3.1:
a. The bounding formula here seems a bit disconnected from Section 2.3? But, I don't have immediate ideas on how to make these two sections seem more integrated.
   - ...?

b. I also think the question that this section is trying to address and how it plans to address this question is not very clear in the beginning. Perhaps, start with "the first question we address is whether bounds from bivariate data with a single instrument is useful in the sense of providing some information about the magnitude and the direction of the ATE. To achieve this, we will construct bounds from bivariate data across different DGPS and ....". I think the intro to Section 4 does a good job of this.
   - Added introductory paragraph with such an explanation.

The ending portion of this section looks good to me.

c. I would roughly add where each line of the max (or min) bracket comes from, explaining in words that these constraints are roughly from Assumption blank or from the law of probability. To add to this point, we can say some expressions are a consequence of certain IV assumptions while others are results from the polytope constraints in Ramasahi(section Blank and Blank). I don't except that we have every part of this equation/bound explained.
   - TBD
   - The problem is that they all come from the polytope constraints, and I can only really make sense of the once that are related to the law of probability. 

d. After addressing (c), I feel like the explanation of bounds here is more easier to understand than in Section 2.3 and you can perhaps use it as a template to rewrite 2.3 so that it's more presentable.
   - In truth, I'm not sure how to do this while still presenting the theory that this method is based on...
   
e. Perhaps, it may be useful to combine Theorem 3.1 and Cor. 3.2 since the discussion on Theorem 3.1 is lacking compared to the discussion on Cor. 3.2?
   - combined.
   
f. In terms of organization, this is more subjective, but what are your thoughts about (i) explaining the bounds first, (ii) explaining the theory of these bounds, and (iii) simulating the results?
   - Tried to do this, but not sure if I succeeded...

g.  Table 1: perhaps unify $W$ and $w$? Or to make it even clearer, we can write out, in words, the column names (e.g. % of Bounds With Width > 1)
    - Changed column names.

Section 4:
a. The model should have a citation (i.e. who else used a variant of this model in the past? Is this model plausible, in some sense? How/why are the parameters specifically chosen this way.)
   - Included sentence to justify the use, but missing references still.
   
b. For the Uniform, I think having (0,1/n) is fine to me, but if you have any concerns, let me know.
   - done.
   
c. I feel like this section needs more explanation about why we are seeing the result in Fig 3 I think your explanation of the Figure 2 would be a good example to follow here.
   - done.
   
d. I also think going deeper into explaining the implications of Figure 2, especially when we take intersections (if all IVs are believed to be valid) or unions (if only one IV is valid) or some combination will all lead to conservative bounds would be useful here. I think your last paragraph of Section 3.1. is a good example to follow here.
   - done.

Section 5.1
a. This is minor, but this section sounds a bit repetitive, especially given the information from the prior section? One suggestion is to merge 5.1 with 5.2, where you start off by introducing the first equation in 5.1 and then talk about how this equation, at the extrema, lead to the following min/max expressions for the trivariate distributoin in Section 5.2.
   - done. 

Section 5.2 (Now 5.1)
a. Similar to my advice on 3.1(c) above, briefly explaining where some of the max/min operations come from could be useful.
   - done.

Section 5.3 (Now 5.2)
a. I think this section has all the right content, but just requires a bit at the beginning about why we're starting with the single IV case, what this section plans to address, and how we plan about addressing it may be useful.
   - done.
   
b. Fix/connect "Row c is similar..." with the paragraph "An important note:"
   - done. Expanded on the former, and moved the latter to directly follow this.
   
c. For Tables 2 and 3, I'm wondering if it's possible to display this in the same grid-like structure as the plot?
   - done.
   
Section 5.4 (Now 5.3)
a. I forget, are we planning to expand this section?
   - Decided yes.
   - Expanded a bit. Not sure what else is needed.

   - TBD: state formally how we get to intersections, make target clear.

Section 6:
a. I would be a bit more specific about the data cleaning/harmonization/data prep process (e.g. linkage equilibrium defaults, clumping defaults, etc.)
   - done. Not sure if more is needed...
   
b. I would also add descriptive statistics table/plot about the data (e.g. what were the marginal P(X|Z),P(Y|Z) estimates after data cleaning, what were the original summary stats, etc). Since there are many IVs, I would put plots with summary stats in the main text and in the supp, provide a full table with the exact numerical values.
   - TBD.


Section 6.1
a. While describing the results, I would not use enumerate/lists. I would try to incorporate them into paragraphs. Also, there is a typo on "intercepting these intervals"
   - done.
   
b. Currently, while the necessary results/text are there, it would be great to have a unifying message at the end. Also, the paragraphs are bit too unstructured (stream-of-consciousness-like?) rather than having some structure (e.g. what are we trying to establish here and why are we doing it, how are we going about to establish this, and what are the results/takeaways). I can help you work on this latter part for the next revision and help you structure your thoughts here.
   - done. Might also need more work...

d. Some references to prior work looking at the relationship between smoking and depression through MR and other means are needed. Ideally, having their magnitudes (even if they are not in the same scale as ours) would be useful.
   - TBD.

Section 6.2.
a. Same as above; some references to prior work looking at the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, through MR and other means are needed.
   - TBD
c. This section in general needs more content (e.g. explaining the results in-depth, final thoughts about this positive control, etc.) as well as structure (see Section 6.1(b))
   - first go, done. Might need a second revision.

Section 7:
a. I think this section is well-written. My only suggestion is to separate  "conclusion" portion (e.g. our results from above) and our suggestions/practical considerations where you would have two separate paragraphs for each; currently, both are integrated with each other. Also, when doing this, we can make the practical considerations portion much longer than the conclusion portion; it  might even be useful to have bullet points here so that people can quickly get the takeaway message from the paper.
   - Gave it a shot, but find it difficult to distinguish between "conclusion" and "practical considerations". Might have to give it another go...


Other Thoughts:
a. I think for the next round of revision, if you can send me the Rmarkdown file, I can start to directly edit on it. Ideally, if you have a cloud storage service that you use (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, One Drive, Box, etc.), that would make the collaboration portion easier.
   - will invite to collaborate on github repo
b. Also, for the next round of revision, I would add an abstract at the top.


### Figures
Figure 4: I would make the panel labels (a,b,c; 1,2,3) larger, ideally at the same font size as the X/Y axis. Also, X-axis is missing a label. In the plot caption, I would explain exactly what each color represents.

Figure 7/8/9/10: Captioning missing. Also, remove id:ukb; fix x-axis label; replace legend's "TRUE" to human-readable ones;  remove SNP1:rs to simply rs; have legend for dotted lines, etc.. I'm not sure if it's possible to make this plot bigger by using landscape plotting in latex?

Y = sum_{z,x} I(Z=z,X=x) Y(z,x)
