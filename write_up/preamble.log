! LaTeX Error: \usepackage before \documentclass.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.1 \usepackage{
                amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb,amsthm}
\usepackage may only appear in the document preamble, i.e.,
between \documentclass and \begin{document}.

! Undefined control sequence.
l.3 \theoremstyle
                 {plain}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.


! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

l.3 \theoremstyle{p
                   lain}
You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.
