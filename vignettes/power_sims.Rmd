Here we briefly show how the monte carlo integration that provides the data used in `vignette("power_sims_figures")` was performed. This happens in two steps: (1) create $10,000,000$ observations of $(X,Y,Z,U)$, and (2) summarize the simulated observations to get $P(X|Z)$ and $P(Y|Z)$. 

The first script showed below uses `simulate_data()` to simulate $10,000,000$ observations for one of the combinations of $\beta_X, \gamma_1, \gamma_U$. The other coefficients are set as $\beta_0 = -\beta_X / 2, \beta_U = \gamma_U, \gamma_0 = -\gamma_1$. (See `simulate_data()` for more details on the model.) The
